      <h1>How does debt work</h1>
      Debt can be defined as something owed. Remember that clay or papyrus record? It represents
      something owed - a certain number of your sacks of wheat stored in a keep that can be
      collected at will by you in the future. Think of it as a deposit you’ve made. It is value owed
      to you. It is also called a liability for the storage place - an obligation that they are
      liable to care for it on your behalf. What if someone other than you comes to the storage
      facility while you are not around and asks for wheat to plant now with a promise to bring back
      all of it plus more next year. That promise is called credit. The promise is from the borrower
      or debtor to the lender or creditor to bring back all of the wheat plus more, typically
      recorded as a fraction of the whole - say 10 percent or 1/10th more. This “more” part is
      typically called interest. It’s your wheat, not the storage facility’s, but let’s say when you
      agreed to store it there, you also agreed that they could give it out to someone you don’t
      know in return for some payment to you. Say you agreed to be paid 1/20th of the total you’ve
      stored. Now the storage facility took your wheat and gave it to someone else to plant in
      return for a promise to bring it back next year whole plus 1/10th more. You have a recorded
      claim on the bank and the bank has a recorded claim on someone else. Importantly though, that
      someone else now has wheat to plant, grow and then to harvest. Your wheat now works as an
      asset for the bank earning interest. It is the same wheat that otherwise would have been
      sitting in storage being eaten by mice. Now you can see how value can be created through
      credit. It no longer needs to involve a palace or a temple, but can be done by a private bank.
      The business of private banking is to collect net interes margin, which is 1/10th that they
      hope to earn lending out minus 1/20th that they have agreed to pay to you. It is risky because
      their liability to you can only be fulfilled if they get paid in the future by the creditor.
      Private banks do not want you to pay to much attention to that risk. So, for a long long time,
      private banks liked to house themselves in buildings that resembled palaces or temples - just
      to make sure that in your mental time travel you can trust them. Because trust in having the
      ability to take your deposit out whenever you wish is at the core of the banking business. You
      can see why. More often than not, your deposit has been lent out to someone you don’t know who
      has planted it and has to wait until the next harvest. Between now and the next harvest, all
      that’s inside a grand, temple-looking structure of a bank is a book of recorded claims written
      in a special accounting language full of symbols. This book is called a ledger. Banking,
      credit, debt and money were being used in the ancient Mediterranean and beyond - in Egypt,
      Greek islands, Babylonia, Anatolia and Canaan - until about 1200 BCE. Then something really
      bad happened. There is no consensus on what it was - a massive drought, a huge volcanic
      eruption, an earthquake or a pandemic have been mentioned among others - but all sophisticated
      civilizations in that area suddenly collapsed. Cities and towns disappeared, some of them
      forever, temples were abandoned, trade stopped, people forgot how to use the accounting
      language. Most people forgot how to read and write altogether. Their mental time travel became
      very short - to survive another day and then a night. And for a long time they forgot about
      the money.
