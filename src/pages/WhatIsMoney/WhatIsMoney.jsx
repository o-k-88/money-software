      <h1>What is money</h1>
      Money is really any medium that is commonly accepted to transfer value from the past to the
      present and from the present to the future. This medium can be tangible - something that you
      can see and feel - like metal or paper or plastic. Or intangible - something that human senses
      cannot process - like an encrypted piece of computer code. What do humans need money for? To
      exchange for something of need or importance to them now or to set aside for something of need
      or importance to them later. See, it’s human mental time travel again - from the past to the
      present and from the present to some imagined future. Some of what is considered to be of need
      or importance to humans stayed the same for millennia and some changed a lot. What stayed the
      same is commonly referred to as death and taxes. I would also add weddings and debt to that.
      Why death? From time immemorial, crimes of violence, especially if they resulted in the death
      of a human had be settled in a form that satisfied the aggrieved family that lost a valuable
      member by the family of the criminal. This type of payment was used to stop feuds between
      families or clans that otherwise could go forever and greatly weaken both families. Written
      laws for these types of payments sometimes known as “blood money” have been found in a lot of
      human civilizations - from Mesopotamia, to ancient Germany, to the Pacific Coast of North
      America to the present where they are called “wrongful death settlements.” Wedding payments,
      which also have been around since time immemorial and continue in many civilisations to this
      day, represent the payment for a more happy occasion. But, since they are viewed as a loss of
      a family member by one family and a gain of a family member by the other family, they too
      require a payment from the gaining to the losing side. In some societies, the gaining family
      is the groom’s family, while in others, it is the bride’s family - and the direction of
      payment is arranged accordingly. In accordance with ancient customs, to this day neither
      wrongful death settlements nor wedding gifts are taxable, which brings us to taxes. What about
      taxes? Taxes generally pay for some sort of service delivered or promised to be delivered in
      the future by those who collect tax revenues now. One of the most important services was, is,
      and will continue to be is called “security.” Security from the enemies foreign and domestic
      is typically delivered by those who are willing and able to withstand violence - from chiefs
      and warlords to the armies raised by the kings, emperors and nation states. Another type of
      security that for a long time was offered in return for payment was delivered by the priests.
      In return for a sacrifice now, the priests promised to deliver spiritual protection and even a
      particular kind of afterlife in the future. Priests and kings collected taxes mostly in kind
      and they needed large and strong buildings to store what they’ve collected. These buildings
      were often large enough to provide secure storage facilities for grains and other storable
      commodities. Earliest forms of banking seem to have originated in and around palaces and
      temples that were used for storage. What was stored was recorded on a separate medium such as
      clay tablets or papyrus sheets. The possessor of that record could come back to the storage
      facility in the future and claim the stored commodity minus taxes and fees. The possessor did
      not have to be the original owner of the commodity - and with that the era of banking and
      credit has began.
